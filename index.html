                remain
                open. If both images are different then the cards will
                close.Please donot click any cards until the incorrect cards closed.The game will continue until the
                player finds all the matching cards.

        <h2> Benefits of Playing Memory Game</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing memory games can improve other brain functions, such as attention, concentration, and focus.
                Memory games give space to critical thinking and that helps children nurture their attention to detail.
            </li>
            <li>Memory games can improve visual recognition. With many memory games based on spotting differences, or
                linking two related images, children improve their visual discrimination. This will lead to an
                acceleration in distinguishing images from one and another. </li>
            <li>Short-term memory is key to playing memory games and playing them often will improve function in this
                area. A good short-term memory can improve a person's long-term memory too. Both are linked and being
                able to move things from your short-term memory into long-term will improve learning in other areas.
            </li>
            <li>Though memory games are a short-term boost, players have to plan their moves as they go. From revealing
                a card to plotting their next move, children can learn the importance of thinking ahead and plotting
                their next choice.</li>
